          </h2>
          <p>
            These are lists of readings and videos organized around topics. Each topic will have one recommended reading and video.
            There are many available resources that can be confusing. 
            You can choose to start reviewing through this list
            and refer to more resources if you want in depth discussions or 
            answer other sample tests later when you feel the need to practice more.
            They can function as trackers by copying the Google Sheets into your own account
            and setting due dates for your own study plan.

      <p>There are many kind hearts in the internet who shared their review materials for free. In keeping with the spirit
      of making knowledge and exam preparations remain accessible, please do not sell or use the resources gathered here
      for commercial purposes. I personally formatted the review trackers but
      all resources posted here are compilations of existing materials except for the sample tests section.
      Many thanks to FilipiKnow, Amoeba Sisters and the anonymous people who compiled the Google Drive folder of "College Entrance
      Tests and Learning Materials". Please do attribute them whenever sharing these materials.</p>
