Hi! I'm Gladys Regalado, a sometimes-creative-coder and free software advocate. I'm slowly organizing my little experiments and projects with friends on my github repository.

I like to work with paper, code and electricity. These days it's mostly paper, and sometimes code. I would like to work on physical computing and electronics again but I'm doing things one at a time.

Karaoke prompter studies by Shin Chan and Gladys. Exploring the karaoke as teleprompter and a lot of singing.
